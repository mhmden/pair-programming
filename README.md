# School Management Project

The purpose of this project is to test the success of the pair-programming process, and to see if major improvements are to be gained from it. The process is basically an alternation between the roles of 'navigator' and 'implementer'. The navigator just guides the implementer using verbal instructions, and the implementer follows this strict guidelines of the implementer. 

The functional and non-functional requirements of the project have not yet been determined. Only the technologies as well as scope of the task.

Here is a list of the implementations we'd like to use.

- Docker
- Laravel Sail
- Git
- VScode & Liveshare extensions

The following is a list of the Laravel and PHP practice I'd like to implement. Feel free to add anything you'd like.

- The Builder Trait Implementation
- Service Classes
- Model Repositories.
- Stubs.
- Custom Validation Rules & Request Classes.
- Global Helpers
- Observers And Events
- Pipelines for filtering.
- Input Sanitization
- Indexes only to query the data.
- Service Provider and The Container (This I am not familiar with very well)
- Polymorphic relationships
- Cron Jobs
